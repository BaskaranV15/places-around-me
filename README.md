        <h1>The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnava community, from the Brahmin varna. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Ulagalantha Perumal and Poongothai. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.[4]

Various festivals are celebrated in the temple, with the 15-day Panguni Brahmmotsavam in March–April with Sri Pushpavalli Thayar Oonjal, being the most prominent one. During the Masi Magam festival celebrated in February–March, the festive deity is carried on the shoulders of devotees to Cuddalore. Other festivals are Purattasi Pavithra Utsavavm, Navaratri, Srirama Navami, Sri Ramanuja Jayanthi, Vasanth Utsavam in April–May, Vaikasi Visaka Garuda Seva, NammAlvar Sattrumurai in May–June, Aani PeriAlvar Sattrumurai in June–July, Aadi Thiruvadipooram, Andal Utsavam in July–August, Avani Sri Jayanthi, Uriyadi utsavam in August–September, Aipasi Mudalazwar Sattrumurai, Sri Manavala Mamunigal utsav in October–November, Karthikai Kaisika Ekadasi, Tirukarthikai in November–December, Margali Rapathu, Pagal Pathu and Vaikunta Ekadashi in December–January.[4]

Religious significance
The temple is revered in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Tirumalisai Alvar in one hymn. The temple is classified as a Divya Desam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book.[4] The temple is counted among the three Divya Desams that has Ulagalantha Perumal as the presiding deity, with the other two being Kanchipuram Ulagalantha Perumal temple and Kazheesirama Vinnagaram at Sirkali.[13]

<h1>history</h1>
<h1>
    It was originally under the rule of Malayaman Malayarayan chieftains [9] and later switched hands to Miladudaiyar and again went back to Malayaman Malayarayan chieftains. Both Miladudaiyars and Malayaman Malayarayan chieftains had direct relationship with the Medieval Cholas, with their princess Sembian Mahadevi daughter of Malavarayar marrying Gandaraditya and Vanavan Mahadevi marrying Sundara Chola and gave birth to Rajaraja I, the illustrious Chola king.[10] There are multiple inscriptions in the temple from Chola, Pandya, and Vijayanagara Empire indicating donations to the temple. An inscription from Rajendra Chola II indicates that the temple was called Thiruvidaikali Alvar temple. A chieftain by name Ranakesari Raman reconstructed the whole sanctum with granite as the old structure built of bricks developed cracks. He also built five pinnacles, the veranda and the hall in front of it. Another inscription during the regime of Rajadhiraja Chola in 1171 CE indicates the donation of seven kalanju (a measure used in olden times) by a lady for the conduct of festivals of Vaikasi and Aippasi and also for the recitation of Tiruvaymoli sung by Nammmalvar in the temple.[11]

The temple was originally made of bricks, but during the period of Virarajendra Chola (1063–70), a granite structure was developed. Narasimha Varma constructed the other shrines also in granite. The temple received benevolent contributions from most of the later Chola rulers like Rajadhiraja Chola (1018–1054), Rajendra Chola II (1051–1063) and other rulers of the region like Vikramapandiya, Koperujinga and Vijayanagara rulers like Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya (1485–1491) and Sadasiva Raya (1542–1570) as seen from the inscriptions in the temple. The temple was expanded during the rule of the Vijayanagar kings and Nayaks. The temple was the fortress to the British during the Carnatic wars. It was also attacked during the days of the period of Hyder Ali.[12]
